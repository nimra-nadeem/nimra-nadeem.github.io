I am a Software Engineer in the Bloomberg Law department at Bloomberg LP. I graduated from Princeton University in 2021, with a Bachelors of Arts (A.B.) with High Honors (*Magna Cum Laude*) in Computer Science and a certificate in [Values and Public Life](https://uchv.princeton.edu/academic-programs/values-and-public-life) with a thematic focus on *Theories of Social and Political Justice*. I am interested in natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and computational control, and I care deeply about AI ethics, fairness, regulation, and safety. Below are some fun things I did during my undergraduate years.
