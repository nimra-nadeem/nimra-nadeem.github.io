I am a first-year graduate student in Princeton University’s MSE Computer Science program, advised by [Professor Peter Henderson](https://www.peterhenderson.co/). Prior to graduate school, I spent three years at Bloomberg Law, where I worked on both traditional ML models and LLMs for applications in the legal domain. Before that, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from Princeton University, advised by [Professor Elad Hazan](https://www.ehazan.com/) with a minor in [Values and Public Life](https://uchv.princeton.edu/academic-programs/values-and-public-life) (thematic focus on *Theories of Social and Political Justice*). I am originally from Islamabad, Pakistan but did my last two years of high school at [UWC Red Cross Nordic](https://uwcrcn.no/), in a tiny town by a magnificent fjord on the west coast of Norway.

My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, law, normative political theory, and public policy. I am particularly interested in understanding the normative, regulatory and technical foundations required to uphold justice, accountability, and democratic values in the era of foundation models and to ensure that major developments in AI truly serve the public good. In alignment with these goals, my technical research focuses on designing reliable and responsible AI systems for high-stakes applications, particularly in law and education.

Outside of work, I am always down for an outdoor adventure - whether it’s backpacking on suspiciously unmarked trails, cycling along unplanned routes, or wandering aimlessly through the woods. Over the past couple of years, I've gotten hooked to Brazilian jiu-jitsu and been attempting (somewhat unsuccessfully) to learn the sitar.

Below are some fun things I did during my undergrad years.
